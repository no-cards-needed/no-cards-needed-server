# No Cards Needed Server
The Gameserver for the No Cards Needed App

## Why is this empty?
There currently is no gameserver for No Cards Needed, but we think this would be the ideal way forward.

If you want to contribute, please feel free to start this development. I think Typescript or Rust would be the ideal languages for this, as they already fit in our tech stack.

For inspiration or help, you can take a look at the current implementation for gameserver logic.
